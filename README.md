# Description


A Discord/Slack-like clone with websockets targeted towards school districts (each school email domain has their own space). Has an admin page for viewing user reports and moderating servers, allows users to create their own servers with invite-only or open-access, shows who's currently typing in a chat in real-time, has markdown formatting, allows admin of servers to send emails to entire server or to specific members, and has multiple themes.
